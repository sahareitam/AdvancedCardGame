# AdvancedCardGame

## Overview
This repository contains projects developed as part of an advanced programming course. Each project demonstrates key programming concepts, ranging from Bash scripting to object-oriented programming and data handling in C.

## Project Structure
The repository is divided into four main assignments:

### Assignment 1 - Bash Script
- Implements automation tasks using Bash scripting.
- Located in the `Assignment1` folder.
- [Details in the README for Assignment 1](Assignment1/README.md).

### Assignment 2 - Pokémon Pokedex in C
- A C program simulating a Pokémon Pokedex with modular structure and memory management.
- Located in the `Assignment2` folder.
- [Details in the README for Assignment 2](Assignment2/README.md).

### Assignment 3 - Basic Card Game Simulation
- A simple card game simulation demonstrating basic OOP concepts.
- Located in the `Assignment3` folder.
- [Details in the README for Assignment 3](Assignment3/README.md).

### Assignment 4 - Advanced Card Game Simulation
- Extends the basic card game with additional gameplay mechanics and character classes.
- Located in the `Assignment4` folder.
- [Details in the README for Assignment 4](Assignment4/README.md).

## Features
- Demonstrates a variety of programming paradigms:
  - Bash scripting for task automation.
  - Modular C programming for managing data.
  - Object-oriented design in C++ for card games.
- Modular design for easier code maintenance.
- Well-structured examples of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Requirements
- A Unix-based system or terminal for Bash scripts.
- GCC compiler for C assignments.
- A C++ compiler for card game assignments.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the respective assignment folder:
   - `Assignment1` for the Bash script.
   - `Assignment2` for the C-based Pokémon Pokedex.
   - `Assignment3` for the basic card game.
   - `Assignment4` for the advanced card game.
2. Follow the instructions in the project-specific README files to compile and run.
