# AdvancedCardGame

## Overview
This repository contains projects developed as part of an advanced programming course. Each project demonstrates key programming concepts, focusing on object-oriented programming and gameplay mechanics in C++.

## Project Structure
The repository is divided into two main assignments:

### Assignment 1 - Basic Card Game Simulation
- A simple card game simulation demonstrating basic OOP concepts.
- Located in the `Assignment1` folder.
- [Details in the README for Assignment 1](Assignment1/README.md).

### Assignment 2 - Advanced Card Game Simulation
- Extends the basic card game with additional gameplay mechanics and character classes.
- Located in the `Assignment2` folder.
- [Details in the README for Assignment 2](Assignment2/README.md).

## Features
- Demonstrates a variety of programming paradigms:
  - Object-oriented design in C++ for card games.
  - Modular design for easier code maintenance.
  - Examples of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler, such as GCC or Clang.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the respective assignment folder:
   - `Assignment1` for the basic card game.
   - `Assignment2` for the advanced card game.
2. Follow the instructions in the project-specific README files to compile and run.
