# Assignment 4 - Advanced Card Game Simulation

## Overview
This project extends the basic card game simulation by introducing new gameplay mechanics, additional classes, and object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. It features various characters and advanced interactions.

## Project Structure
- `Card.cpp`, `Card.h`: Card management functionality.
- `Deck.cpp`, `Deck.h`: Deck management functionality.
- `Dragon.cpp`, `Dragon.h`: Implementation of a Dragon character.
- `Enemy.cpp`, `Enemy.h`: Base class for enemies.
- `Player.cpp`, `Player.h`: Player class for gameplay mechanics.
- `Ranger.cpp`, `Ranger.h`: Specialized player class.
- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the program.
- `Makefile`: Build instructions for compiling and running the project.

## Features
- Multiple character types, including Dragon, Ghost, Troll, and more.
- Dynamic interactions between players and enemies.
- Card set management and gameplay progression.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
- Make utility to build the project.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the program using the `Makefile`:
   ```bash
   make
