# AdvancedCardGame

## Overview
This repository contains two projects developed as part of an advanced programming course. Both projects focus on card game simulations, demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Project Structure
The repository is divided into two main assignments:

### Assignment 3 - Basic Card Game Simulation
A simple card game simulation focusing on foundational object-oriented programming concepts. This assignment includes:
- Managing a deck of cards.
- Implementing basic game logic.
- Demonstrating modular design with classes.

[More details can be found in the `Assignment3/README.md`](Assignment3/README.md).

### Assignment 4 - Advanced Card Game Simulation
An extension of the basic card game, featuring:
- Advanced gameplay mechanics.
- Additional character types such as Dragons, Ghosts, and Trolls.
- Usage of inheritance and polymorphism for dynamic gameplay.
- More complex interactions between players and enemies.

[More details can be found in the `Assignment4/README.md`](Assignment4/README.md).

## Features
- Modular design for easier code maintenance.
- Demonstration of core OOP principles:
  - Encapsulation (managing card and deck functionality).
  - Inheritance (base and derived classes for enemies and players).
  - Polymorphism (dynamic behavior of characters).
- Makefile for streamlined compilation and execution.

## Requirements
To compile and run the projects, you will need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
- Make utility.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the respective assignment folder:
   - `Assignment3` for the basic card game.
   - `Assignment4` for the advanced card game.
2. Compile the program using the `Makefile`:
   ```bash
   make
