# Assignment 3 - Basic Card Game Simulation

## Overview
This project implements a basic card game simulation using object-oriented programming principles. It includes classes for cards and a deck, and demonstrates foundational OOP concepts such as encapsulation and modular design.

## Project Structure
- `Card.cpp`, `Card.h`: Implementation and header files for managing individual cards.
- `Deck.cpp`, `Deck.h`: Implementation and header files for managing a deck of cards.
- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the program.
- `makefile`: Build instructions for compiling and running the project.

## Features
- Create a deck of cards.
- Shuffle and draw cards.
- Manage card properties and deck interactions.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
- Make utility to build the project.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the program using the `makefile`:
   ```bash
   make
